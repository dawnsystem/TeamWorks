# Touch and Drag Issues - Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
The application had issues with touch interaction for task dragging:
1. Tasks could not be moved by holding and dragging on touch devices
2. When holding, text would get selected and a context menu would appear
3. Text selection needed to be available only when intentionally selecting
4. Context menu should close when starting to drag a task

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Text Selection Prevention
**Files Modified:** `client/src/components/TaskItem.tsx`

- Added `userSelect: 'none'` and `WebkitUserSelect: 'none'` CSS properties to the draggable task container (line 377-378)
- Added `userSelect: 'text'` and `WebkitUserSelect: 'text'` to the task content area (line 402-403)
- This prevents text selection during drag gestures while still allowing users to select text when clicking directly on the content

### 2. Context Menu Handling on Touch Devices
**Files Modified:** `client/src/components/TaskItem.tsx`

- Created `handleContextMenu` function to intelligently handle context menu events (line 342-362)
- On touch devices (detected via `'ontouchstart' in window`), prevent the default context menu from appearing on long-press
- On desktop devices, context menu still works via right-click
- This prevents the context menu from interfering with drag gestures on mobile/touch devices

### 3. Touch Sensor Optimization
**Files Modified:** `client/src/components/ProjectView.tsx`

- Adjusted TouchSensor activation constraints:
  - Reduced delay from 250ms to 200ms (faster activation)
  - Increased tolerance from 5px to 8px (allows slight movement before activating)
- This provides better responsiveness while still distinguishing between tap and drag gestures

### 4. Context Menu Cleanup on Drag Start
**Files Modified:** `client/src/components/ProjectView.tsx`

- Added explicit context menu hiding when drag starts (line 115-116)
- Ensures any open context menus are closed when a drag operation begins

## How to Test

### Testing on Touch Devices (Mobile/Tablet)
1. Open the app on a mobile device or tablet
2. Navigate to a project with tasks
3. **Test Drag:**
   - Press and hold a task for ~200ms
   - Move your finger - the task should start dragging
   - You should NOT see text selection or context menu
4. **Test Text Selection:**
   - Tap on the task title/description area
   - Try to select text by pressing and holding on a word
   - Text selection should work normally
5. **Test Context Menu:**
   - Long-press should NOT show context menu (this is intentional for drag)
   - Use the three-dot menu or other UI elements to access task actions

### Testing on Desktop
1. Open the app in a desktop browser
2. Navigate to a project with tasks
3. **Test Drag:**
   - Click and hold a task
   - Move the mouse - the task should drag
   - Text should not be selected during drag
4. **Test Text Selection:**
   - Click and drag within the task text
   - Text selection should work normally
5. **Test Context Menu:**
   - Right-click on a task
   - Context menu should appear normally

## Technical Details

### CSS Properties Applied
```css
/* On draggable task container (depth 0) */
user-select: none;
-webkit-user-select: none;

/* On task content area */
user-select: text;
-webkit-user-select: text;
```

### Touch Sensor Configuration
```typescript
useSensor(TouchSensor, {
  activationConstraint: {
    delay: 200,      // 200ms delay before drag starts
    tolerance: 8,    // 8px tolerance for movement
  },
})
```

### Browser Compatibility
- The fix uses standard CSS properties with vendor prefixes
- Touch detection uses the standard `'ontouchstart' in window` check
- Compatible with all modern browsers and mobile devices

## Files Changed
1. `client/src/components/TaskItem.tsx` - Main touch/drag fixes
2. `client/src/components/ProjectView.tsx` - Sensor optimization and context menu cleanup

## Testing Results
- ✅ All 40 existing tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint checks passing
- ✅ CodeQL security analysis passed (0 alerts)
- ✅ Build successful

## Notes
- Context menu on touch devices is intentionally disabled for draggable tasks to prevent conflict with drag gestures
- Users can still access task actions through other UI elements (edit button, task detail view, etc.)
- On desktop, right-click context menu continues to work normally
- Text selection is fully functional when not dragging
